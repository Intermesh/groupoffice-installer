# GroupOffice 7 installer
This project contains the code for installing "groupoffice-server" REST API and the "groupoffice-webclient" Web client for GroupOffice.

The release files contain the installer, server and client but the source code is just the installer.

For installation just download the files and unpack them in a web accessible folder. Then open this location in your browser and follow the installation steps.
